            There are various possible health benefits of milk, such as bone and brain health. However, there are also potential risks, especially for those with allergies or intolerances.

Milk is a good source of many essential nutrients, including calcium, protein, and vitamin D. Many people see it as a vital part of a balanced diet. Others, however, cite various reasons for choosing not to consume it.

Sources of milk and milk products include cows, sheep, camels, goats, and many others. Milk alternatives include soy milk, almond milk, flax milk, coconut milk, and hemp milk.

This article will focus on the benefits and risks of drinking cow’s milk.

            Milk’s healthfulness depends on the individual and the type of milk they consume.

Pasteurized milk that is high in protein, low in fat, and free from unnecessary additives can be healthful for many people.

On the other hand, some flavored milks contain as much sugar as a can of soda. These are not a healthful choice.

Present day cow’s milk is not a single product. It can be fresh or long life, fat free, lactose free, fortified with added omega-3s, hormone free, organic, or raw, among other options.
